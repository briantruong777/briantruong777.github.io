title: About Me
---

One of my favorite video games as a child was [Logical Journey of the
Zoombinis]. Since then, software has been a part of my life in some way or
another. In high school, I joined our [FIRST Robotics] team which got me hooked
onto the engineering side of software. That led me to [University of Illinois
at Urbana–Champaign] where I graduated with a BS/MCS in Computer Science. I was
a TA for Computer Architecture, Systems Programming, and Software Design
Studio. Other than those areas, I'm also interested in programming languages,
compilers, algorithms, distributed systems, and networking. Nowadays, I work as
a software engineer for [Google].
