title: About Me
---

One of my favorite video games as a child was [Logical Journey of the
Zoombinis]. Since then, software has been a part of my life in some way or
another. In high school, I joined our [FIRST Robotics] team which got me hooked
onto the engineering side of software. That led me to [University of Illinois
at Urbana–Champaign] where I graduated with a BS/MCS in Computer Science. I
ended up being a TA for 3 different courses: Computer Architecture (CS 233),
Systems Programming (CS 241), and Software Design Studio (CS 126). Other than
those areas, I'm also interested in programming languages, compilers,
algorithms, distributed systems, and networking. Nowadays, I work as a software
engineer for [Google].
